# Metro-Route-Application
This is a desktop app which will provide a solution to finding the shortest available metro service in Delhi-NCR. It basically works on Djikstra's Shortest path algorithm.

# Data structures elements used in basic Algorithm :

1) Graphs: The shortest distance between two stations is calculated with the
help of graphs.
Graph provides us nodes that can symbolize a single stations .Using
graphs , the complexity can be reduced efficiently.
2) File handling :The map showing the stations all across the city can be
entered and stored for further use using file handling.
3) Graphics*: The application can be visually shown using the graphics .
It gives the project a mature visual.
4) Vector: The entries can be stores in the vectors rather than using arrays
as the size of the entry of the graph is big and unknown .

# Overview :

We have covered the following grounds under this project :

Shortest route: Describing the route ,the passenger will take to reach the
destination covering the shortest possible path. It is calculated using the
djikstra() function.

Fare calculation :Depending upon the distance the he/she has travelled ,
the average fare will be charged according the rules laid down by DMRC
and is calculated using the money() function.

Average time: The estimated time to reach the destination.
Stations in between : Stations which lie in between the path and train will
stop there is shown using the path() function.

Average Distance : the expected average distance is calculated using the
minDistance() function.

Change of lines: The user is also notified of the line he or she has to change and at
which station to reach the destination.
